# odin-recipes
This is a simple recipes site I am making while working through The Odin Project.
The site consists of a very simple (for now) home page containing links to a couple of recipes.
Each recipe link takes you to a page containing the recipe where you will find a image of the finished product,
a short description, a ingrediants section, and a section containing a list of steps on how to prepare the meal
